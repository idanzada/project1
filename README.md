## Integration with robot_car_v2 Model

This project integrates with the `robot_car_v2` model to enhance its capabilities. The integration allows project1 to utilize advanced features provided by the `robot_car_v2` model.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the robot_car_v2 Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/idanzada/robot_car_v2.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure that all dependencies required by the `robot_car_v2` model are installed. You can typically find these in the `requirements.txt` file of the `robot_car_v2` repository.
   ```bash
   pip install -r robot_car_v2/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   Configure the environment to recognize and utilize the `robot_car_v2` model. This may involve setting environment variables or modifying configuration files within project1.

### Synchronization Process

The synchronization process is handled by a script named `sync_with_robot_car_v2.py` located in the project1 repository. This script fetches the model, loads it into the project1 environment, and performs any necessary preprocessing or postprocessing steps.

For more detailed instructions on running the synchronization script, refer to the comments within the `sync_with_robot_car_v2.py` file.
